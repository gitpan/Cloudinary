DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you interface to <http://cloudinary.com>.

SYNOPSIS
  Standalone
        my $delay = Mojo::IOLoop->delay;
        my $cloudinary = Cloudinary->new(
                             cloud_name => '...',
                             api_key => '...',
                             api_secret => '...',
                         );

        $delay->begin;
        $cloudinary->upload({
            file => { file => $path_to_file },
            on_success => sub {
                # ...
                $delay->end;
            },
            on_error => sub {
                # ...
                $delay->end;
            },
        });

        # let's you do multiple upload() in parallel
        # just call $delay->begin once pr upload()
        # and $delay->end in each on_xxx callback
        $delay->wait;

  Options
    As from 0.04 all methods support the short and long option, meaning the
    examples below work the same:

        $self->url_for('billclinton.jpg' => { w => 50 });
        $self->url_for('billclinton.jpg' => { width => 50 });

  url_for() examples
        $cloudinary->url_for('billclinton.jpg', { type => 'facebook' });
        $cloudinary->url_for('billclinton.jpg', { type => 'twitter_name', h => 70, w => 100 });
        $cloudinary->url_for('18913373.jpg', { type => 'twitter_name' });
        $cloudinary->url_for('my-uploaded-image.jpg', { h => 50, w => 50 });
        $cloudinary->url_for('myrawid', { resource_type => 'raw' });

METHODS
  upload
        $self->upload({
            file => $binary_str|$url, # required
            timestamp => $epoch, # time()
            public_id => $str, # optional
            format => $str, # optional
            resource_type => $str, # image or raw. defaults to "image"
            tags => ['foo', 'bar'], # optional
            on_success => sub {
                my($res) = @_;
                # ...
            },
            on_error => sub {
                my($res, $tx) = @_;
                # ...
            },
        });

    Will upload a file to <http://cloudinary.com> using the parameters given
    "cloud_name", "api_key" and "api_secret". $res in "on_success" will be
    the json response from cloudinary:

        {
            url => $str,
            secure_url => $str,
            public_id => $str,
            version => $str,
            width => $int, # only for images
            height => $int, # only for images
        }

    $res for "on_error" on the other hand can be either "undef" if there was
    an issue connecting/communicating with cloudinary or a an error:

        {
            error => { message: $str },
        }

    The "file" can be:

    *   A hash

            { file => 'path/to/image' }

    *   A Mojo::Upload object.

    *   A Mojo::Asset object.

    *   A URL

    "res" in callbacks will be the JSON response from
    <http://cloudinary.com> as a hash ref. It may also be "undef" if
    something went wrong with the actual HTTP POST.

    See also <https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images> and
    <http://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#raw_uploads>.

  destroy
        $self->destroy({
            public_id => $public_id,
            resource_type => $str, # image or raw. defaults to "image"
            on_success => sub {
                # ...
            },
            on_error => sub {
                my($res, $tx) = @_;
                # ...
            },
        });

    Will delete an image from cloudinary, identified by $public_id.
    "on_success" will be called when the image got deleted, while "on_error"
    is called if not: $res can be either "undef" if there was an issue
    connecting/communicating with cloudinary or a an error:

        {
            error => { message: $str },
        }

    See also
    <https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#deleting_images>.

  url_for
        $url_obj = $self->url_for("$public_id.$format", \%args);

    This method will return a public URL to the image at
    <http://cloudinary.com>. It will use "private_cdn" or the public CDN and
    "cloud_name" to construct the URL. The return value is a Mojo::URL
    object.

    Example %args:

        {
            w => 100, # width of image
            h => 150, # height of image
            resource_type => $str, # image or raw. defaults to "image"
            type => $str, # upload, facebook. defaults to "upload"
            secure => $bool, # use private_cdn or public cdn
        }
